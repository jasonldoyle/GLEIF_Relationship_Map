# GLEIF Relationship Map

**Interactive visualization of global corporate ownership structures using GLEIF‚Äôs Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) dataset.**

Built as a full-stack web application, this project maps relationships between legal entities (e.g., parent‚Äìsubsidiary or fund‚Äìmanager links) using a **graph network and hierarchical tree view**.  
It provides users with a clear and interactive way to explore the real-world corporate structure behind LEIs.
